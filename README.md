# Hanoi_Tower
The program visualizes the state of the Tower of Hanoi using HTML and CSS.

Disks are represented as div elements, and their positions are updated dynamically to reflect the state of the Tower.

The program assumes the existence of an HTML document with an element with the id 'game' and an input field with the id 'numDisk'.

The visualization is likely intended to be displayed on a webpage.
